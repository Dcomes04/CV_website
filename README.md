## Project Overview
This is a personal CV website where I present my academic and professional background, skills, and portfolio projects. The website is designed to help visitors easily find information about my experience, skills, and the projects I have worked on.

## Project Analysis

### User Profile
**User Persona**:  
**Name**: Montserrat Martorell  
**Age**: 32  
**Occupation**: Recruitment Specialist at a technology company  
**Goals**: She wants to learn about my qualifications and experience to see if I might be a good choice for a job in her company. She wants a clear and simple view of my education, work experience, skills, and past projects the I have worked on. Montserrat prefers a design that is easy to use and allows her to quickly find the information she needs.  
**Frustrations**: She does not like complicated or messy websites. She wants a design that makes important information easy to find without distractions. She also wants to be able to click on sections and go directly to them without too much scrolling.

### Information Architecture
The website has a single-page design with clear sections for each type of information. To help users move around the page, they can click on menu items that will automatically scroll down to the right section. Here’s how the page is organized:

1. **Introduction**: At the top, I introduce myself by my name and my current role as a Computer Engineering student.
2. **Contact Information**: Below the introduction, this section shows my contact details (phone number, email and social media links) so visitors can easily contact me if they are interested of my profile.
3. **Personal Information**: This section shares my interests and hobbies, offering a more personal view of who I am outside of work. This type of information can give them some important details of my behaviour.
4. **Work Experience**: This part lists my previous jobs, with job titles and main responsibilities, giving an overview of my work experience.
5. **Academic Background**: This section summarizes my education, including degrees and important courses.
6. **Skills and Languages**: Here, I list my technical skills and languages I know, even if I speak it fluently or I have to practice more to improve myself.
7. **Projects**: The last section shows selected projects I have worked on in previous years. Users can click the arrows to go between projects, and the active project changes using JavaScript for a better experience.

This layout is simple and logical, helping users find information easily and without distractions.

### Visual Design
For the visual design, I chose a professional and simple style to make the page easy to read and pleasant to look at. The **color palette** mostly uses shades of blue and gray, which make the page look professional. Blue is used for important sections like headings and links to make them easy to see, and gray is used for the background to keep the page clean and simple.

The **typography** uses the Inter font, chosen because it looks modern and is easy to read. Titles and section headings are larger and bold to stand out, while the body text is smaller, which makes it easy to follow each part of the page without it looking crowded.

The **layout** has a lot of space between sections to help each one stand out and make the page easy to follow. Each section is aligned in a way that keeps the page organized, making it simple for users to read and find what they need. In the projects section, I added some interactivity with JavaScript, allowing users to click the arrows to switch between projects. The arrows also change color (to gray) to see you have to click the other arrow to see the other project. The website design adjusts well to different screen sizes, so it works on both computers and mobile devices.
